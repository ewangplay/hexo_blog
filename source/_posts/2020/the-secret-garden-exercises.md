### 3 What do you think will happen to Mary, Colin, and Dickon in ten years' time? Write another paragraph to finish the story.

当柯林和玛丽长到到二十岁时，他们仍然住在米塞思韦特庄园。

他们的朋友迪肯也依然住在附近的村子里。他们几乎每天见面和玩耍。

玛丽长得非常漂亮，像她的妈妈，高高的个子，白皙的皮肤，金黄的头发，明亮的眼睛。每一个见到她的人都禁不住地喜欢她，特别是柯林和迪肯，他们同时爱上了玛丽，但他们谁都不挑明。

有一天，迪肯在来庄园的路上采集了一大束美丽的鲜花，送给了玛丽。玛丽非常高兴。她把这束鲜花插到花瓶里。她每天起床第一眼看到这束鲜花，一天的心情都轻松而愉快。

柯林看在心里，知道玛丽更喜欢迪肯。他很伤心，不好好吃饭，无端地发脾气，甚至有几天都不怎么理玛丽。

但过了一段时间，他逐渐想通了。他爱玛丽，就应该让她幸福，让她追求自己的真爱。

柯林终于下定决心，他想去外面看看。外面的世界那么大，有很多新鲜的事物等着他去探索。更重要的，他想成全迪肯和玛丽。

后来，玛丽嫁给了迪肯，她搬到了迪肯的村子里住，虽然物质生活上不丰富，但他们过得很幸福。他们依然经常到秘密花园中，种植、除草、散步、跟小动物们玩耍。

柯林游历遍了欧洲各地，见过很多的人，经历了很多的事。见识了海阔天空，他的心在一天天的成长。后来，在一次游历中，他遇到了自己喜欢的女孩。他们一见钟情。他们一起回到了米塞思韦特庄园，见了他的秘密花园，见了他的老朋友——迪肯和玛丽。

现在秘密花园中总是有四个人的身影了。

When Colin and Mary were twenty, they still lived at Misselthwaite Manor.

Their friend Dichon till lived in the village nearby. They met and played almost everyday.

Many was very beautiful, like her mother, tall, fair skin, golden hair, and brilliant eyes. Everyone who met her could not help liking her, especially Colin and Dichon, who were both in love with Mary, but neither of them said it openly.

One day, on his way to the Manor, Dichon gathered a large bunch of beautiful flowers and gave them to Mary. Mary was very happy. She put the bunch of flowers in one vase. When she first saw the bunch of flowers when she got up, she was in a light and cheerful mood all day.

Colin knew in his heart that Mary preferred Dichon. He was very sad. He didn’t eat well, lost his temper for no reason, and even didn’t pay much attention to Mary for a few days.

But after a while, Colin gradually figured it out. He loved Mary, should let her happy, should let her follow her true love.

Colin made up his mind at last, he wanted to go outside. The world outside was so big that there were so many new things for him to explore. More importantly, he wanted to fulfill Mary and Dichon.

Later, Mary married Dichon and moved to his village, where they lived happily, though not materially. They sill went to the secret garden regularly, planting, weeding, walking and playing with animals.  

Colin travelled all over Europe, met lots of people and experienced a lot of things. Seeing the broad sky, his heart was growing day by day. Later, during a trip, he met a girl he liked. They fell in love at first sight. Together they went back to Misselthwaite Manor and met his secret garden and his old friends, Mary and Dichon.

Now there were always four of them in the secret garden.
