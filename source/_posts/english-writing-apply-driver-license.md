This morning, my sister and I went to the HongLiDa driving school to apply a driver’s license.

Because the HongLiDa driving school is very close to my home, so we walked to the school directly.

First, we asked some questions to their staff, tried to understand the process of the learning  to drive a car.

After we knew it, we filled in the application form and paid the cost of learning, a total of 5400 yuan——the two of us.

Then the staff called a driver to take us to the Traffic Management Department to have a medical examination.

The driver is a very nice man, we talked a lot on our way to the Traffic Management Department.

About 15 minutes, we arrived the Traffic Management Department.

At first, we went to take pictures, 20 yuan per person. and filled a medical examination form, 30 yuan per person.

Then walked the medical examination ——  visual inspection, color blindness inspection, body coordination check, etc. About 10 minutes, I finished the examination. But my sister met some trouble when the examination  of the color blindness. She couldn’t  distinguish the color numbers, so the inspector wouldn’t let her through. She became very anxious, and the inspector became very impatient.

I said to her don’t worry, clam down and well take a look. as long as not color blindness, will be able to see out.

Finally, she passed. It’s great!

The driver drove us back to the HongLiDa driving school. We put the health declaration to the staff there and record the electronic  information.

Then it was over. We went home.
